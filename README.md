PiWiFi
======

PiWiFi is an open source project for providing free social WiFi using Raspberry PI hardware. The project uses Coova  chilli as its captive portal software and authentication using social login such as facebook, twitter, google plus services. This can be useful for Cafe, Clubs to offer free wifi and in return get some 'likes' or 'follows'. 

Hardware:
You need one raspberry pi and a USB WiFi dongle which supports Access point(AP) feature and Mirco USB power supply.

The repository contains instructions and code for tweaking existing Pi distribution to bring up PiWiFI
